**Description**

The goal of the Story feature is to provide users with quick access to each source‚Äôs top news. The Story section displays the top 5 most-viewed articles per source, refreshed every 6 hours, with the same stories shown consistently on both mobile and desktop. Stories are ordered by Visit Count (descending), and in case of ties, by Publish Date (descending).

## üìù STEP 4

1. As a user, I want to see the title of each news article in the story, so that I can quickly understand the main topic before reading more.
<br />
<br />

2. As a user, I want stories to be grouped by source, showing the top 5 most-viewed articles for that source in the last 6 hours, so that I can catch up quickly.
<br />
<br />

3. As a user, I want to know how recent each news article is, so that I can decide whether the information is still relevant.
<br />
<br />

4. As an admin, I want to track article views (and compute the ‚Äútop 5 in the last 6 hours‚Äù), so that the Story set is always based on accurate popularity data.
<br />
<br />

5. As a user, I want each story item to include a visual thumbnail, so that the content feels more engaging and helps me understand the news at a glance.
<br />
<br />

6. As a user, I want to see the name and logo of the news source with each article, so that I know where the information is coming from and can judge its credibility.
<br />
<br />

7. As a user, I want each story to stay on screen for a few seconds before automatically moving to the next, so that I can view the content comfortably without needing to interact manually.
<br />
<br />

8. As a user, I want to know which stories I have already viewed (seen/unseen), so that I can focus only on the new or unseen stories.
<br />
<br />


9. As an admin, I want the system to always present exactly five stories per source on both mobile and desktop, so that the experience is consistent.
<br />
<br />


10. As a user, I want stories to automatically expire after 6 hours and be replaced by the newly computed top 5, so that I always see the most current popular content.
<br />
<br />

11. As a user, I want to be able to react to story items using emojis, so that I can quickly express my opinion without leaving the story.
<br />
<br />

12. As a user, I want the same five stories and the same order on mobile and desktop, so that my experience is consistent across devices.
<br />
<br />

13. As a user, I want the stories within a source ordered by most-viewed first, and when two items have the same views, the newer one should appear earlier.
