**Description**

A responsive app install popup designed to improve user onboarding by prompting visitors to open or install the Pelikan Media application. The popup appears once per session or based on certain triggers (e.g. first visit or repeat engagement), providing a seamless choice between app usage and continuing on the browser.

## üìù STEP 3

1. As a first-time visitor to the website, I want to see a popup introducing the Pelikan Media app, so I become aware of the app‚Äôs existence and can choose to install it if I prefer using apps.
<br />
<br />

2. As a visitor who already has the app installed, I want to tap "Open in App" and be redirected directly into the app, so I can continue browsing in a more optimized native environment.
<br />
<br />

3. As a visitor who does not have the app installed, I want to be redirected to the App Store or Google Play after tapping "Open in App", so I can easily download and install the app.
<br />

4. As a visitor who prefers to use the browser, I want to tap "Continue in Browser" and stay on the current page without any reload or disruption, so I can keep reading seamlessly.
<br />
<br />

5. As a user, I want the popup to appear only once per session (or based on a condition), so I‚Äôm not repeatedly interrupted during my browsing experience.
<br />
<br />

6. As a mobile, tablet, or desktop user, I want the popup to be responsive, so it fits nicely on any screen I‚Äôm using and maintains usability.
