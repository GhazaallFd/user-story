**Description**

The goal of this feature is to deliver high-quality, summarized news updates to users via a dedicated Telegram channel. The channel will publish 10‚Äì15 curated news items per day, selected based on trending tags or high visit counts. News summaries are generated by the technical team or AI, then reviewed and edited within a private Telegram group before being published. Posts are scheduled for release at specific times, with the option to manually publish urgent or trending stories as needed.
