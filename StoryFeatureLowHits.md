## üìù STEP 3

**Description**

The goal of the Story feature is to increase the visibility of fresh, low-view news articles.
Instead of focusing only on the most-viewed content, we‚Äôre introducing a Story section that highlights lesser-seen news related to trending topics, presented in  engaging format.

## üìù STEP 4

1. As a user,
I want to see the title of each news article in the story,
So that I can quickly understand the main topic before reading more.
<br />
<br />

2. As a user,
I want stories to be grouped and shown based on trending topic tags,
So that I can easily find news that matches my current interests.
<br />
<br />

3. As a user
I want to know how recent each news article is,
So that I can decide whether the information is still relevant.
<br />
<br />

4. As an admin,
I want to track how many views each article has received,
So that I can manage which articles should be promoted or replaced in the Story section.
<br />
<br />

5. As a user,
I want each story item to include a visual thumbnail,
So that the content feels more engaging and helps me understand the news at a glance.
<br />
<br />

6. As a user,
I want to see the name and logo of the news source with each article,
So that I know where the information is coming from and can judge its credibility.
<br />
<br />

7. As a user,
I want each story to stay on screen for a few seconds before automatically moving to the next,
So that I can view the content comfortably without needing to interact manually.
<br />
<br />

8. As a user,
I want to know which stories I have already viewed,
So that I can focus only on the new or unseen stories.
<br />
<br />


9. As an admin,
I want to set a view limit for each story,
So that low-visibility news can rotate out after reaching a fair exposure level.
<br />
<br />


10. As a user,
I want stories to automatically disappear after a fixed time (like 24 hours),
So that I always see only the most recent and relevant content.
<br />
<br />

11. As a user,
I want to be able to react to story items using emojis,
So that I can quickly express my opinion without leaving the story.
